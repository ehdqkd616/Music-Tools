"""§5.2.1 vocal/instrumental separation.

Runs on CUDA in this stack (NVIDIA GPU host). `DEMUCS_DEVICE` stays
configurable via .env for anyone running this on a CPU-only or AMD box
(set it back to "cpu" and swap requirements-separate.txt's wheel index).

torch/torchaudio/demucs are imported lazily inside each function, not at
module level. `workers/tasks/__init__.py` imports every task module — including
this one, transitively, via tasks/separate.py — in every worker process so
Celery can register all tasks. The download/dsp/beat containers only install
the lightweight base requirements (no torch), so a module-level `import torch`
here would crash their startup even though they never execute this code
(they never consume from the `separate` queue).
